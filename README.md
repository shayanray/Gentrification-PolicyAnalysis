# Name of the project
Bicycle Transportation & Gentrification and Displacement in Southern California

## Installing / Getting started

Install anaconda to open and run the notebooks

1. No significant correlation between bicycle infrastructure to gentrification and
displacement in LA and Orange County (in urban vs suburban vs rural areas) between 1990-2000 and
2000-2015

2. Bike lanes are built in established neighborhoods, but their development does not
necessarily attract people

## Policy Recommendations
